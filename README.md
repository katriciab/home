### Welcome Home - is a home automation app.
This app was created for people like myself who love to adorn their home space with lights everywhere, but really wish these lights were like the sun - bright during the day when I want to get things done, but becomes warmer as the sun comes down and as I reach my bed time. So, that's what this app does, and should be coming to the App Store soon, so [keep an eye out](http://twitter.com/katriciab)!

This app requires [Philips Hue lights and a bridge](http://www2.meethue.com/), and was built by [Katricia](http://www.katriciab.com/) to play with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).
